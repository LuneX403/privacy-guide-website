            <h2>Advanced Privacy & Security Practices</h2>
            <p>For those seeking the highest levels of digital defense, consider these advanced strategies:</p>
            <div class="content-grid">
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>Hardware-Level Security</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dedicated Privacy Devices: Consider using a separate device for highly sensitive tasks (e.g., an older ThinkPad with a stripped-down OS).</li>
                        <li>Physical Disconnection: For extreme privacy, physically disable or remove internal microphones and webcams from laptops. Use external peripherals only when needed.</li>
                        <li>Hardened Firmware: Research options like Coreboot or Libreboot for open-source BIOS/UEFI replacements on compatible hardware to mitigate firmware-level attacks.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>Network Layer Hardening</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>VPN Kill Switch: Ensure your VPN has a kill switch that automatically blocks all internet traffic if the VPN connection drops, preventing accidental data leaks.</li>
                        <li>Tor Over VPN: For enhanced anonymity, route your VPN traffic through Tor (VPN -> Tor). Be aware this can significantly slow down your connection.</li>
                        <li>MAC Address Randomization: Configure your devices to randomize their MAC address when connecting to Wi-Fi networks, making it harder to track your device's physical location.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Regular Audits: Periodically audit your system logs and installed software for unusual activity or unauthorized installations.</li>
                        <li>Data Encryption: Ensure full disk encryption (FDE) is enabled on all your devices (laptops, phones) to protect data at rest.</li>
                        <li>Secure Boot: Verify Secure Boot is enabled on your PC (if supported) to prevent unauthorized operating systems or malware from loading during startup.</li>
